### File system interfaces

These are not really file systems; they allow access to file systems from an operating system standpoint.

* FUSE (file system in userspace, like LUFS but better maintained)
* LUFS (Linux userland file system – seems to be abandoned in favour of FUSE)
* VFS Virtual Filesystem
* Callback File System – the SDK to build custom filesystems and plug them to Windows OS.
